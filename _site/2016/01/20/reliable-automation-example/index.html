  <h1 class="post-title">A Test Automation Story</h1>
  <span class="post-date">20 Jan 2016</span>
  <p>I find that doing repetitive computer-related tasks is time consuming, error-prone and frustrating. 
I am a strong believer of automating everything and I have this mantra:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Automate anything that you did twice as you will certainly have to do it a third time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This article describes my approach to automate a time consuming task in my daily workflow.</p>

<p>I am working on <a href="https://www.Mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial</a>. Whenever I work
on a new series of patches, I want to ensure that the whole test suite passes
on every patch of the series. In the end I made this task completely <strong>automated</strong> and <strong>transparent</strong>. </p>

<hr>

<h3>Iteration Zero: run the tests and go grab a drink with a friend</h3>

<p>The very first time I ran the Mercurial test I stared at my screen while the tests results
were being slowly displayed. After a while, I went to grab coffee, came back, and all the tests had run. I swore to myself that I would never waste more time staring at the screen waiting for the tests to finish. The first
step to a successful automation is getting frustrated with doing things manually.
Some people never get frustrated by that but I have a pretty low tolerance for
repetitive tasks!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not saying that Mercurial tests are too slow, they actually take typically
less than 5 minutes to run. For tests that take one hour to run, people
don&#39;t hesitate to automate the process. For tests that take 2 minutes, most
people think they can stand staring at their screen and it is a <strong>mistake</strong>! 
Automate <strong>all the things</strong>, don&#39;t manually do the same thing <strong>twice</strong> and you
will improve!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>First iteration: Open a new window, type some commands, check later</h3>

<p>The first improvement I made was opening a new terminal window to run all the tests.
This was better than waiting for the tests to finish. If you are not using
a terminal multiplexer, I strongly advise you to do so, check out <a href="https://tmux.github.io/">tmux</a>.
While running the tests, I was being careful not to modify any files to avoid messing up the results of the test.</p>

<h3>Second iteration: Isolate testing and work environment</h3>

<p>Soon after, I decided to have two copies of the Mercurial repository. I kept one copy  to run the test
completely in RAM (for the sake of speed) and one copy on disk on which I was working. After
finishing a patch, I would push my changes to the test repository and run the
tests while not being blocked to make further changes. This created a separation
of environment between the test environment and the development environment, effectively
overcoming the main issue of the first iteration.</p>

<p>Despite being an enhancement over the previous iteration, four key things were missing:</p>

<ol>
<li>I still had to type commands to push the changes, checkout the revisions
and run the tests</li>
<li>If I had to test 10 patches, I would have to launch them one by one</li>
<li>I had to look through the test results and take note of what passed and what
didn&#39;t pass</li>
<li>There was no neat way for me to see what changes pass the test and what changes
didn&#39;t pass the test</li>
</ol>

<h3>Third iteration: Avoid unnecessary typing</h3>

<p>I got fed up with typing the commands to push my changes, check them out
and run the tests. I did some research and figured out that tmux allows
you to open new windows and run commands in other windows programmatically. 
I used this API and scripted tmux to open a new window to run my tests.</p>

<h3>Fourth iteration: Getting tired of reading test output</h3>

<p>I realized that our tests runner could produce a JSON report with the results
of each test. There was a bug where the output was not a valid JSON and it didn&#39;t
contain some of the information I needed so I sent patches upstream. Once fixed
I managed to get my previous automation to read the report, archive it, parse it
and give me a summary. I decided to store all these information in SQLite to
easily query them later.</p>

<h3>Fifth iteration: When it gets serious</h3>

<p>My main issue at that point was that I was launching the tests one by one and
being careful not to launch two at a time. I added a task queue to my system using
<a href="http://www.celeryproject.org/">Celery</a> to separate launching the tests and running them.
This way also, I can run the tests on multiple machines in the future or run unrelated tests in parallel. 
At this point, I hooked up tests for other repositories and not just the core Mercurial repository.
I built a command line tool to easily select what tests to run and to query the tests
results and failures.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/listcset.png" alt="List of changesets and test results"></p>

<p>One thing was missing, I still had to read the reports to know when the tests were passing.</p>

<h3>Sixth iteration: Cherry on the cake: a hud, colored labels, and vim integration!</h3>

<p>It is extremely easy to write Mercurial extensions, it can take as little as 
5 lines of python to create a useful feature. I wrote an extension that adds an
overlay on top of the list of commits in my repository to show me if the tests
passed for each revision:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/slog.png" alt="Changelog"></p>

<p>I added a status bar in tmux to inform me of what is being tested and I am thinking
of adding an ETA for the tests.</p>

<p>Finally, I added shortcuts in vim to launch tests against the current revision,
the current stack and see test results.</p>

<h3>Future iterations: Dependencies, packaging, and distribution</h3>

<p>I installed this automation on three machines already and it works great! 
Moving forward, I want to distribute this system to more people. I will write
more about it and talk about implementation details in other articles. </p>
