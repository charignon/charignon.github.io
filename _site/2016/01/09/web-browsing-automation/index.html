<p><strong>mechanize</strong> is a library to interact with websites. It fits in between 
high-level browser automation tools like <strong>Selenium</strong> and HTTP libraries like 
<strong>requests</strong>. It doesn&#39;t handle Javascript, if that&#39;s an issue for you, you 
should consider <strong>CasperJS</strong>. The big advantage of using mechanize compared to 
a higher level library is speed: it is an order of magnitude faster!</p>

<p>I use the following boilerplate code for all my programs with <strong>mechanize</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Set up user agent

Load cookies from a file

If the cookies are expired:
    Go through the login flow

Interact with the website

Persist the cookies to a file
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you do the following instead:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Go through the login flow

Interact with the website
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, you will end up going through the login flow as many times as you run the
script. Not only will this be inefficient, but you would also take the risk of 
being <strong>blacklisted</strong> by the website&#39;s owner for making too many requests.
Let&#39;s see in practice what this code looks like.</p>

<h2>Boilerplate</h2>

<p>Assuming that you want to log into a website and read a page that shows some
JSON content, you would do something like this: </p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">json</span>

<p>Now, some of you might wonder &quot;how do you figure out what the URLS/parameter 
are for the stuff that you are interested in&quot;. It is actually fairly easy to
gather that information.</p>

<h2>Figure out the API behind a website</h2>

<p>This explanation assumes that you are using <strong>Google Chrome</strong>, tools exists with 
many other browser to do the same thing.</p>

<p>Open the Developer Console and go to the <strong>Network Tab</strong>. Click on the button
to start a recording and navigate to a page.</p>

<p>You will see a bunch of requests, filter the kind that interests you, you 
generally want to see the requests for web pages and XHR, click on both and
see if you find something interesting.</p>

<p>In my case, I am looking at a website that gives the location of my phone, I
filtered the XHR requests:
<img src="/assets/webauto1.png" alt="XHR requests"></p>

<p>It looks like the first entry is very interesting:
<img src="/assets/webauto2.png" alt="First entry"></p>

<p>From there, right click on the request and you can copy the URL and information
to make the request from python or a terminal:
